AutoFlow Agent
An intelligent AI-powered automation platform that combines web browsing, file management, and Python execution capabilities to autonomously complete complex tasks with built-in success criteria evaluation.

Features
Autonomous Task Execution: Uses LangGraph state machines to break down and execute complex multi-step tasks

Web Automation: Integrated Playwright browser automation for web scraping and interaction

Success Criteria Evaluation: Built-in evaluator that ensures tasks meet specified requirements

Multi-Tool Integration:

Web browsing and navigation

File management operations

Python code execution

Wikipedia research

Push notifications

Web search capabilities

Interactive Chat Interface: Clean Gradio-based UI for seamless interaction

Memory & Context: Maintains conversation history and task context across interactions

Architecture
The project uses a sophisticated agent architecture built on:

LangGraph: State graph management for complex workflows

LangChain: LLM integration and tool orchestration

Groq: High-performance LLM inference

Playwright: Headless browser automation

Gradio: Modern web interface

Quick Start
Prerequisites
Python 3.10+

Git

Installation
Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/23shivay/AutoFlow-Agent.git
cd AutoFlow-Agent

Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Install browser for Playwright

playwright install

Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your API keys:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
PUSHOVER_TOKEN=your_pushover_token_here
PUSHOVER_USER=your_pushover_user_key_here
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key_here

Running the Application
python app.py

The application will launch in your default browser at http://localhost:7860.

üîß Configuration
Required API Keys
Groq API Key: Get from Groq Console

Pushover (Optional): For push notifications - Pushover.net

Serper API (Optional): For web search - Serper.dev

Environment Setup
The application creates a sandbox directory for file operations. Ensure proper permissions for file read/write operations.

üí° Usage Examples
Example 1: Web Research Task

Message: "Research the latest developments in AI and create a summary"

Success Criteria: "Create a comprehensive summary with at least 5 recent developments, including sources"

Example 2: Data Processing

Message: "Download weather data and create a visualization"

Success Criteria: "Generate a graph showing temperature trends with proper labels and save as PNG"

Example 3: File Management

Message: "Organize files in the current directory by type"

Success Criteria: "Create folders for different file types and move files accordingly"

üîç How It Works
User Input: User provides a task and success criteria.

Task Planning: The agent analyzes the request and plans execution steps.

Tool Execution: Agent uses available tools to complete sub-tasks.

Evaluation: Built-in evaluator checks if success criteria are met.

Iteration: If criteria aren't met, agent continues working with feedback.

Completion: Final result is presented to the user.
